# TF2 Scripts
 
### What is this?
 - This is essentially a backup of my key bindings for TF2

### Configs

#### Spy2.cfg
 - `Mouse Wheel Up` - Select Gun
 - `Mouse Wheel Down` - Select Knife
 - `Left Click` - Attack and then re-disguise if you stop attacking
 - `Midde Click` - Regular attack with no auto disguise
 - `Right click` - Cloak / Dead Ringer
 - `Mouse4` - Get the sapper out and use it as long as you're holding the key, then put it away and get your old weapon out if you let go
 - `R` - Drop all disguises
 - `1-9` - Put a ENEMY disguise of a given class on based on the number
 - `shift + 1-9` - Put a FRIENDLY disguise of a given class on based on the number
   - `1` - Scout
   - `2` - Soldier
   - `3` - Pyro
   - `4` - Demoman
   - `5` - Heavy
   - `6` - Engineer
   - `7` - Medic
   - `8` - Sniper
   - `9` - Spy

#### Pro tips:
 - If you disguise as something like a medic, you can change guns and then disguise again, you will select what ever weapon slot matches with the disguise
 - For medic, select the sapper, redisguise and you will have the medic gun out, so much less sus
