# TF2 Scripts
 
### What is this?
 - This is essentially a backup of my key bindings for TF2

### Voting Commands
 - Sometimes the UI messes up and no one can vote, you can vote and get free choice of map via the following commands:
 - `next_map_vote 0` Vote for the first option
 - `next_map_vote 1` Vote for the second option
 - `next_map_vote 2` Vote for the third option

#### Pro tips:
 - If you disguise as something like a medic, you can change guns and then disguise again, you will select what ever weapon slot matches with the disguise
 - For medic, select the sapper, redisguise and you will have the medic gun out, so much less sus
